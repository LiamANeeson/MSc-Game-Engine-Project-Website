Glad 

1. The interim report was overall good. 

2. We were able to use the game engine API to build a game.


Sad 

1. Need more data points.

2. Need a better user evaluation plan.

3. Not everybody was able to get code submitted.

 

Mad 

1. Deployed version of website didn’t have content.

2. Code on main wasn’t working again, need to review code base - ‘working on my machine’ problem.


Conclusion & future planning: 

1. We will ensure there is enough time during the week for everybody to submit some code onto GitHub.

2. We will push forward with the different features of the game engine to try and prioritise ‘Scene view port’ and ‘textures’ features this sprint.

3. Need to get all 6 team members working on the game engine for the next few weeks to push forward with feature list.
