Glad:
1. Lecturers were happy to see a lot more features and UI implementation, giving them more insight into how the game engine will work.
2. New entity component system, with more efficient algorithms.
3. Shout out to Minghui’s content browser work last week (Drag and drop functionality).
4. All team members worked well together last week to get game engine code working.

Sad:
1. All code was on separate branches for demo.
2. Lecturers would be happier to see progress with the data aspect of the project.
3. Long PR’s, lecturers would be happier to see more code review engagement.

Mad:
1. Information silos on PR’s, the whole team should keep this in mind.
2. Scripting is still the last blocker to complete the game engine and start the game.

Conclusion & Planning:
1. Need to do a code review this week.
2. Make sure all branches are merged by Thursday during the week to make sure the demo is on one laptop.
3. Need to do research on data element.
4. Need to complete user evaluation and report.
