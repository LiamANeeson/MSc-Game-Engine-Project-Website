Week 10 – retrospective

Glad:
1. Making good progress with scripting and visual scripting.
2. Sprite sheets, sprites and texture rendering is completed, can now show assets on screen
3. Codebase is refactored making it easier to debug 
Sad
1. Scripting not complete
2. Bugs in the game engine – need to be fixed, to sort out scripting
3. Bugs in website – need to be fixed
4. Finish off website
5. Game not started needs to be evaluated as well
Mad
1. A lot of work to do, with two weeks left
2. Mad that building a game engine is like opening pandora’s box, more complicated than we anticipated.
Conclusion& planning:
1. Starting the game this week using the API, to keep moving forward with it
2. 3 people working on website to try finish it.
3. 2 people working on the game engine
