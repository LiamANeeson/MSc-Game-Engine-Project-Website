Week 7 – Retrospective

Glad:
- A lot of Game engine UI tickets have been knocked off, beginning to take shape (Looks like the wireframe).
- Website bugs sorted out; website hosted in its current state
- Got a head start on the user evaluation report about 50% done (PR on GitHub)

Sad: 
- Lectures still unclear as to full functionality of game, need more cohesive game engine.
- Team members attention was drawn away from game engine to sort out website bugs.
- As a result, team progress on the game engine was a bit slower than expected this week.

Mad:
- Team members are a bit annoyed we can’t show our game yet as we need to implement more game engine features.

Conclusion & planning:
- With regards to game engine features, we are working this week (week 8) to aggressively knock off the features needed to show lecturers a cohesive a game engine as soon as possible, so we can start making the dark patterns game.
- We hope to start looking into the data and intelligence aspects of the project (DP data, asset management data aspects and machine learning/intelligence).
- Continue to progress with user evaluation.
