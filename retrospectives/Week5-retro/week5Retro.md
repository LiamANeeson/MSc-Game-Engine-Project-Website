Glad:
1.	Mostly good feedback from lecturers.
2.	Completed feature tasks for week 5.
3.	Good user feedback so far.
4.	Good to see the beginning of connecting the API to the UI.
5.	Tidied up and maintained some bugs and the code base.

Sad:
1.	Some feedback noted we need to start aiming for a cohesive product, showing demo of a game scene.
2.	Still a bit of a lack of understanding as to why all the features are needed from a lecturer point of view. 
3.	Our PR’s are still too big. We should try to break these down more.
4.	Need more comments on PR’s to show collaboration, coordination and understanding between the team.
5.	We didn’t really raise tickets, team members just worked on functionality, sometimes unclear what everyone was working on. 
6.	Lots of pull requests on the website repo in comparison to relatively few on game engine repo. As our main project consists of the game engine there should be more on the game engine.
7.	Could use more user feedback.
Mad:
1.	PR’s still too big.
2.	Tasks and features need to be broken into smaller chunks avoiding information silos. 

Conclusion & future planning:
1.	More stand ups so people can pair up and understand all of the code avoiding information silos.
a.	Up skilling sessions for people so that all members can be comfortable with coding in Game Engine.
2.	Break down features into smaller sizes, avoiding large PRs. In turn help people understand the code better. 
3.	In meetings when discussing features need to discuss if tasks can be broken down further rather than one person working on one large piece of functionality.
