Week 4 reflection
Glad
1. Better feedback from lecturers on week 3 including the prototypes and architecture shown.
2. Good coordination between the team developers, especially when merging branches back to main.
3. Good contribution from all team members.
4. No major blockers.
5. Timely management of our tasks.
6. Good brainstorming session for user evaluation questions.
Sad
1. We had a messy branching structure on GitHub, merging of all branches was overdue.
2. We didn’t break up bigger tasks into smaller more manageable PR’s, multiple features in PR. Need to be spread out better.
Mad
1. Some duplicated code in merges.
2. Small amount of commenting on PR’s, this resulted in a small amount of learning in PR’s.
3. User authentication is broken, this issue will need to be resolved.
4. Ambiguity of the file management is becoming an issue. It is difficult to solve for all use cases.
Week 4 conclusion and future planning:
Overall, the team was relatively happy with how the week 4 sprint went, we managed to reach most targets set. We need to set a definition of done for all tasks. In some of the tasks for week 4, we struggled with some issues such as, scene management, logging class and the file management class. For the sprint in week 5 we aim to solve these issues, a process which may help this will be to work on point 3 in the sad section. We need to set up a process to raise bugs to improve code quality. We hope to improve on this in the week 5 sprint.
